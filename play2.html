    <h6 class="name OLIVER">OLIVER</h6>
    <p class="speech">Let me go, I say.</p>
    <h6 class="name ORLANDO">ORLANDO</h6>
    <p class="speech">I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
    father charged you in his will to give me good
    education: you have trained me like a peasant,
    obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
    qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
    me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
    me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
    ive me the poor allottery my father left me by
    testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</p>
    <h6 class="name OLIVER">OLIVER</h6>
    <p class="speech">And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
    Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
    with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
    pray you, leave me.</p>
    <h6 class="name ORLANDO">ORLANDO</h6>
    <p class="speech">I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</p>
    <h6 class="name OLIVER"> OLIVER</h6>
    <p class="speech">Get you with him, you old dog.</p>
    <h6 class="name ADAM">ADAM</h6>
    <p class="speech">Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
     teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
     he would not have spoke such a word.</p>
